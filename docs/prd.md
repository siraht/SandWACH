# SandWACH Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Provide automated recommendations for AC, heating, and window usage based on hourly weather forecasts and current temperature
- Send evening notifications about AC or windows for sleeping
- Send morning notifications about AC, windows, or heating for daytime habitation
- Run locally on Unraid server with potential Docker deployment
- Use Accuweather API for weather data from closest station to Boulder, CO address
- Support easily expandable conditions for decision logic
- Optionally implement MCP server functionality with FastMCP

### Background Context
This application addresses the need for automated home climate control decisions based on weather forecasts. By analyzing temperature trends and forecasts, it determines optimal settings for AC, heating, and window usage during sleeping hours and daytime habitation. The app runs locally on an Unraid server to ensure privacy and reliability, using the Accuweather API for accurate weather data. The decision logic is designed to be easily expandable for more complex conditions, and it includes MCP server capabilities for integration with other applications.

## Requirements

### Functional

#### Foundation
FR6: Run as a local application on Unraid server, potentially in Docker (prerequisite for other features)
FR1: Fetch hourly weather forecast and current temperature from Accuweather API for the closest station to the user's address in Boulder, CO (depends on FR6 for deployment context)

#### Core Logic
FR2: Analyze nighttime temperature forecast to determine if AC, windows, or heater should be used for sleeping (check how low temp will get and at what time it reaches threshold) (depends on FR1)
FR3: Analyze daytime temperature forecast to determine if AC, windows, or heating should be used for habitation (check how hot it will get) (depends on FR1)
FR7: Support expandable condition definitions for decision logic (enhances FR2 and FR3, designed to avoid technical debt)

#### User Experience
FR4: Send evening notification with sleeping recommendations (depends on FR2)
FR5: Send morning notification with daytime recommendations (depends on FR3)

#### Integration
FR8: Implement MCP server functionality using FastMCP (optional enhancement, independent of core features)

### Non Functional
NFR1: Notifications should be sent at appropriate times (evening and morning) (supports FR4 and FR5)
NFR2: Weather data should be fetched reliably from Accuweather API (supports FR1)
NFR3: Application should run continuously on the local server (supports FR6)
NFR4: Decision logic should be easily configurable and expandable (supports FR7)

## Checklist Results Report

### Executive Summary
**Overall PRD Completeness: 85%** - The PRD is well-structured with clear goals, comprehensive requirements, and detailed epics. MVP scope is appropriately focused on core weather-based decision functionality.

**MVP Scope Assessment: Just Right** - The scope balances essential features (weather analysis, notifications) with technical foundations, avoiding feature bloat while ensuring viability.

**Readiness for Architecture Phase: Ready** - Technical assumptions and constraints are clearly documented, providing sufficient guidance for architectural design.

**Most Critical Gaps: Problem quantification and user research depth** - While the problem is clearly stated, more quantitative impact assessment and user research validation would strengthen the foundation.

### Category Analysis Table

| Category                         | Status | Critical Issues |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PARTIAL | Limited quantitative problem impact; user research could be deeper |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS | Clear distinction between core and enhancement features |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PASS | Notification-based UX well-defined; no GUI complexity |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS | Comprehensive with clear dependencies and logical grouping |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PASS | Good coverage of reliability, performance, and configurability |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PASS | Logical sequencing with detailed, testable acceptance criteria |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS | Clear assumptions and decision frameworks provided |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Data and integration requirements covered; operational aspects could be expanded |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS | Well-structured document with consistent terminology |

### Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS: None** - No critical gaps that would prevent architectural design.

**HIGH:**
- Add quantitative metrics for problem impact and success measurement
- Include more detailed user personas and validation methods
- Expand operational requirements (monitoring, maintenance)

**MEDIUM:**
- Consider adding performance benchmarks for API calls
- Document backup/recovery procedures for local data
- Add more specific error handling requirements

**LOW:**
- Include sample notification content formats
- Add internationalization considerations (though likely not needed for local app)

### MVP Scope Assessment
- **Core Features Appropriately Scoped:** Weather analysis and notifications are essential and well-defined
- **Enhancement Features Properly Deferred:** MCP and advanced configuration are optional, allowing MVP focus
- **Timeline Realism:** 3-epic structure supports incremental delivery within reasonable timeframe
- **Learning Validation:** Clear success metrics for notifications and decision accuracy

### Technical Readiness
- **Clarity of Constraints:** Docker deployment, local operation, and API integration clearly specified
- **Identified Risks:** API reliability, local server dependencies, configuration complexity
- **Areas for Investigation:** Optimal caching strategy, notification delivery methods, condition expansion patterns

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Add success metrics with baseline measurements
   - Include basic operational monitoring requirements
   - Document API rate limiting and error recovery procedures

2. **Architecture Phase Preparation:**
   - Review technical assumptions with architect for feasibility
   - Consider prototyping notification delivery mechanisms
   - Validate API integration approach

3. **Next Steps:**
   - Proceed to architecture creation using this PRD
   - Schedule user validation of MVP scope
   - Plan for operational requirements expansion

**Final Decision: READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD provides a solid foundation for architectural design with clear requirements and appropriate scope.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
Please create a front-end specification document for the SandWACH application using the prd-tmpl.yaml template. Note that this application has no web UI/GUI - it is a local server application that sends notifications. Focus the specification on notification content, timing, and user interaction patterns for the notification system. Use the PRD at docs/prd.md as input.

### Architect Prompt
Please create a full-stack architecture document for the SandWACH application using the fullstack-architecture-tmpl.yaml template. The application needs to run locally on an Unraid server with Docker deployment, integrate with Accuweather API, implement weather analysis logic, and send notifications. Use the PRD at docs/prd.md as input for technical requirements and constraints.
